# Paimon Bot v2

> Dev version still in development...

Some of the features in v1 might be stripped down depending on either they are helpful for genshin players or not!    
Previous version was a spaghetti code | tho it was my best attempt at coding. v2 will be developed at a snail pace, might pick it up if I get off days.
This is basically a hobby and to make good use of my time.


# What to do better

     🔸More centralized than before. [settings | db | autoupdate for characters etc]
     🔸Better Documentation for scripts, code. [previous had almost none]
     🔸Better and beautiful embeds to show descriptions
     🔸Better Co-op system. [co-op profile]




# Contribution
